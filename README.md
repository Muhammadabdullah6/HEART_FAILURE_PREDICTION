# HEART_FAILURE_PREDICTION
## Heart Failure Prediction Web App Repository

This repository contains the files for a web application designed to predict the risk of heart failure using clinical data.

### Key Files:

#### app.py: The core Python script for running the Flask web application.
##### heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv: The dataset used to train the prediction model.
###### heart_failure_model.pkl & model.pkl: The trained machine learning model files (likely in Pickle format).
feature_importance.png: A visual representation of the importance of different features in the model.
heatmap.png: A visualization of the correlation matrix between features.
target_distribution.png: A graph showing the distribution of the target variable (heart failure or no heart failure).
index.html: The main landing page for the web application.
predict.html: The page where users can input data for heart failure prediction.
Purpose:

This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for predicting heart failure risk based on clinical data. The web application allows users to input relevant information, and the trained model provides a prediction. The included visualizations offer insights into the model's behavior and the dataset's characteristics.
